Problem 1:
Suppose we are interested in the buying habits of shoppers at a particular grocery store with regards to whether they purchase apples, milk, and/or bread. Now suppose 30% of all shoppers at this particular grocery store buy apples, 45% buy milk, and 40% buy a loaf of bread. Let  𝐴  be the event that a randomly selected shopper buys apples,  𝐵  be the event that the same randomly selected shopper buys milk, and  𝐶  the event that they buy bread. Suppose we also know (from data collected) the following information:

The probability that the shopper buys apples and milk is 0.20.
The probability that the shopper buys milk and bread is 0.25.
The probability that the shopper buys apples and bread is 0.12.
The probability that the shopper buys all three items is 0.07.
Use this information to answer the following questions.

```
S = c(000,100,110,101,111,010,011,001)
A = c(100,110,101,111)
B = c(010,110,011,111)
C = c(001,010,101,111)
```
